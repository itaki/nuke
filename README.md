# nuke
This is a repository of Foundry Nuke tools. 

This is setup using [NukeShared](https://maxvanleeuwen.com/project/nukeshared/)

The largest part of this repo is [NukeSurvivalToolkit](https://github.com/CreativeLyons/NukeSurvivalToolkit_publicRelease). It is in the autoinstaller folder of NukeShared. If you really want a clean install you should just setup NukeShared and grab the NST from the master repository and install it.

If you like to dig around in stuff like I do, feel free to look through this repo for things you may not have. Or you could install it outright, though no guarentees it will work on the first go.

This repo also includes some utilies outside of NST which include: 

[W_hotbox](https://github.com/jakubjezek001/nuke_w_hotbox) - A hotbox utility like in Maya

[KnobScripter](https://github.com/adrianpueyo/KnobScripter) - An IDE right inside Nuke

[LayerShuffler](http://www.nukepedia.com/python/ui/layershuffler_v1) - A utility for extracting layers from multi-layer files

The NSK repository also has a ton of tools that have been added in both the autoinstaller and in the 'nodes' directory.

Most of these could probably be eliminated and there may be errors with a lot of them. They are the collection I've aquired over the years. Many of them are outdated or in the Nuke Survival Toolkit already. Some duplicates I keep in their appropriate menu places since I don't really like digging in NST for something like an expoblur when I would expect it to be in the filter menu

Most of these were found on Nukepedia, and it is probably better to just install what you need rather than everything.
