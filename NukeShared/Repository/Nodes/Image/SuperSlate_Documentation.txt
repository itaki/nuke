------------------------------

Installation Procedure:

Drag SuperSlate.gizmo and SuperSlateIcon.png to your ~/.nuke directory and add the following line(s) to your menu.py script file:

toolbar = nuke.menu('Nodes')    [ this line is optional since it may already be included in the menu.py file]

toolbar.addCommand('Image/SuperSlate', "nuke.createNode('SuperSlate')",icon ='SuperSlateIcon.png')

--

This will place the Superslate generator in the Image Menu along with it's corresponding icon.
