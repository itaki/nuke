# nuke nodegraph_utils
Collection of utilities for manipulating Nuke's NodeGraph

## Installation
### Easy install
Download the whole .zip file of the project and uncompress it somewhere, for example `C:\Users\my_user\.nuke\node_graph_utils`.
In your `init.py` (see https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/developers/131/pythondevguide/startup.html for more info on init.py), add the following line:

    nuke.pluginAddPath(r"C:\Users\my_user\.nuke\node_graph_utils")

(Ensure you adjust the path to your own install path. It should point to where the provided menu.py lives.)

### Custom Install
You could modify the installation to fit your needs. The simplest modification you could do is to exclude the experimental features.
To do so, locate the provided menu.py and change the line:

    node_graph_utils.install_menus(icons_root=ICONS_ROOT, install_experimental_menus=True)

to

    node_graph_utils.install_menus(icons_root=ICONS_ROOT, install_experimental_menus=False)
If you would like, you could also store the icons in a different location and provide the icons path to this method.

For advanced users, using the pre-made `install_menus` method is optional and all fucntions can be exposed manually from scratch. 


### Customizing keyboard shortcuts
All the menus and keyboard shortcuts are defined in the `install_menus` method, which lives in the package's `__init__.py` file.
By default, I have mapped the shortcuts to be used along with the meta key (windows key on keyboards).
If for example you wanted to remap the "AutoBackdrop" command to Ctrl+B instead of my default Alt+B (because somehow you use nuke's Branch command, which normally has the Alt+B shortcut).
You would locate the line where the command is added:

    backdrop_menu.addCommand('AutoBackdrop', backdrops.auto_backdrop, 'alt+b', shortcutContext=2, icon='Backdrop.png')
and change the shortcut like so:

    backdrop_menu.addCommand('AutoBackdrop', backdrops.auto_backdrop, 'ctrl+b', shortcutContext=2, icon='Backdrop.png')
